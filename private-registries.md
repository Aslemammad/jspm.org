## Private Registries

Private npm or other registry support requires a separate CDN to jspm.dev. Private integrations of the jspm CDN can be provided with a commercial license to be setup on your own infrastructure or cloud and for use over private intranet or a public server with origin-based access control, dependent on the exact needs of the use case.

If you'd like to discuss a private integration of jspm.dev, [get in touch with us](mailto:guybedford@gmail.com).
